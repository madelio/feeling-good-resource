    </h1>
    <p>Simply ways that our mind convinces us of something that isn't really true. These inaccurate thoughts are usually used to reinforce negative thinking or emotions â€” telling ourselves things that sound rational and accurate, but really only serve to keep us feeling bad about ourselves.</p>
